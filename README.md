# MusicSwapper
Music Swapper is a simple desktop application for numerating and changing order of music. It sorts files randomly in selected location. 

## UseCase - explanation
I named it Music Swapper beacouse of the purpose of this application. My car had no USB (yeah, car had no USB input!), though it had car cigarette lighter. I bought a car transmitter to play MY (not radio) music from my pendrive while driving which was compatible with cigarette lighter. The issue was, my transmitter played music only alphabetically...

Aaaaand this is where the application came. It numerates files and randomizes their order in selected directory.
